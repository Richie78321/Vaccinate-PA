# Frequently Asked Questions

<br />

### Who are you?

We are a team of Pennsylvanians who care about our community and want to help our loved ones get vaccinated. We are a volunteer group of engineers, entrepreneurs, community activists and students across PA.

<br />

### What's the goal of this website?

We aim to help Pennsylvanians more quickly, easily and confidently identify where and how to get vaccinated. While the official PA government sources provide some information, the vaccine rollout is rapidly evolving and many Pennsylvanians lack clarity on where, when and how they can actually go to get a vaccine.
By centralizing information on which locations have vaccine inventory, we help eligible Pennsylvanians save time. By calling vaccination locations and publishing the latest information, we ease the load on phone systems at the hospitals, pharmacies and other facilities who are being inundated with duplicative phone calls from residents asking the same question: Can you give me a vaccine?

<br />

### Where is all of this information coming from?

We received the list of vaccination sites from the PA Department of Health. Our team of volunteers is calling those sites to identify current vaccine availability at those facilities. Of course, this information may change frequently and is not guaranteed to be accurate, but we aim to centralize information as recently-updated as possible and provide residents with an effective starting point to identify their options.
