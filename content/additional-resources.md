### Individual scheduling assistance 

VaccinatePA.org is unable to provide individual assistance to schedule vaccines for individuals. However, several volunteer groups provide assistance to seniors who may have difficulty navigating the internet to schedule appointments. We recommend the volunteer Facebook groups [PA Covid Vaccine Match Maker](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pacovidvaxhelp/) (state-wide), [Getting Pittsburgh Vaccinated](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gettingpittsburghvaccinated), and [Lehigh Valley Covid Vaccine Info](https://www.facebook.com/groups/407854377186364/).

In addition, seniors in Southwestern PA specifically may find helpful [these resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwtcoTAFAce4dpSylV1h53dpvFLUBLmRl8HlY_-ezLc/edit), and those who are helping seniors may find helpful [this compilation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NYz7vd9Ed-b6TOK5tOrtqgU8uEfSkrbLrAPaHe0kt4/edit) of vaccine-related information put together by these groups.
