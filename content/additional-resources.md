# Additional Resources

For the latest **official** **updates** and **eligibility information** from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, visit here: [https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Vaccine.aspx](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Vaccine.aspx)

You can also call the PA Department of Health Hotline at 1-877-724-3258.

Note, **Philadelphia** is a separate jurisdiction for the covid vaccine rollout. Philadelphia County has its own timetable, rules and requirements; Philadelphia information can be found **[here](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/vaccines/about-covid-19-vaccine/)**.

### County-specific health information

See **[HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VVtxya-i9Tka6-uhrLvXPan9qqpt8og2Wz-pT8yawng/edit#gid=0)** for a list of all official government health websites for counties in PA. Visit your county’s department of health website, as well as the PA Department of Health website, for additional information on the coronavirus vaccine rollout in your county.

### Where can I get the vaccine?

The list of locations with active vaccine inventory is changing frequently. Our volunteer team calls these locations daily and publishes onto this website which locations have vaccines and how eligible Pennsylvanians can make an appointment. [Search for your county ](https://vaccinatepa.org/)to see that information. (This list of facilities comes from the Pennsylvania Dept of Health’s [official vaccine page](https://www.pa.gov/guides/get-vaccinated/#Step2FindaVaccineProvider).)

It remains difficult even for eligible Pennsylvanians to obtain a vaccine due to vaccine supply shortages. We will continue to update this website as more and more locations receive vaccine supply.

### Data on vaccine shipments

We are also analyzing and visualizing the data, provided by PA Dept of Health, on the shipments of vaccines across the state. See **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11yyHrz0Q46NVBoHL9uP7W266Hvm_09_-FAZYwEhiJGM/edit#gid=1116579145)** for data on how many vaccine shipments have been received weekly across PA, and visit **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KVCR3e9_G6edmEJmAEoXrOfYL7TDJ_Ww_pTBHVWNPHM/edit#gid=2037211880)** to see vaccine shipment data for each healthcare provider in your chosen county.
